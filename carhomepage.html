            <h2>Car History</h2>
            <p>When the first self-powered vehicles were introduced in the late 19th century, the history of cars officially began. Karl Benz is credited with creating the first functional automobile, the internal combustion engine-powered Benz Patent-Motorwagen, in 1886. Steam-powered cars had been developed earlier, but they were not practical for everyday use.

                Henry Ford transformed the industry in the early 20th century by introducing mass production techniques with the 1908 Ford Model T. His assembly line method reduced car costs and increased accessibility for a larger group of people. This signaled the start of widespread automobile use, which changed people's lives, economies, and urban environments all over the world.</p>
